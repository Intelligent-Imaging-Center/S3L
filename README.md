Leveraging Spatiotemporal Cues for Self-Supervised Stereo Depth Estimation in Endoscopic Videos

We have released the segmentation configurations and loading scripts for the SCARED dataset in advance.

We excluded subsets D4 and D5 of the SCARED dataset due to severe calibration inaccuracies and temporal misalignment. The remaining subsets were split as follows: D1–D3 and D6–D7 were used for training, yielding 19 videos with a total of 17,206 frames. D8 and D9 were reserved for testing, providing 8 videos with 5,907 frames.
